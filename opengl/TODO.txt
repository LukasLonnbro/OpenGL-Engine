- RENDEROBJECT :: 
	Don't like "Renderobjects" think they're superflous. Works for now but needs something more proper later. 
- PATHS :: 
	WTF is paths. Static variables everywhere. Works for now but that shit risky. 
	Remove entirely, put into Path superclass instead.
- LOGGER :: 
	Think Im gonna start with a synchronous version, but make asynchronous in future.
- ERROR HANDLING :: 
	Shader setup
	Window
	Setuphandler
